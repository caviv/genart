# genart
A series of generative art machine drawings code

Made together with my son (https://github.com/shtivaerev) as a learning tutorial for javascript, canvas, html

Still a work in process and we will push more new items

# I don't know how to draw

It have all started under the assumption that I don't know how to draw, and if I don't know how to draw then why not to create software that will be able to generate art for me and can draw for me.

So the first genart we have done is the city skyline generator https://www.cnaanaviv.com/genart/skyline/ which is just a sample and we intend to extend it and add more graphics generating, like cars, mountains, the sun or the moon and more ...

And we intend to add more computer generated graphics later on.
